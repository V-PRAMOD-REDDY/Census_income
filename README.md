# Census Income Analysis

This project provides an analysis of the Census Income dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to understand the characteristics of the data and relationships between different variables.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: 
  - Handle missing values.
  - Remove duplicate rows.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Compute summary statistics such as mean, min, and max for numerical columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Analyze categorical and numerical data using:
    - Countplots for categorical variables.
    - Distribution plots for numerical variables.
    - Strip plots to visualize relationships between categorical and numerical variables.

## Dependencies

The script uses the following Python libraries:

- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` for creating static plots.
- `seaborn` for advanced visualizations.
